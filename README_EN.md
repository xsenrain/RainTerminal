## Feature overview

RainTerminal is built for developers and operators who work with multiple Windows / Linux servers and network devices. Everyday tools live in one window while connection profiles, workspace layouts, and appearance preferences persist between sessions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>Terminals and connections</strong><br /><br />
      Local and SSH terminals with password, private-key, and SSH Agent authentication, plus imports from connection text or <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>Files and transfers</strong><br /><br />
      SFTP browsing, text editing, drag-and-drop uploads, download progress, and a shared transfer manager for every file operation.

      <strong>Monitoring and processes</strong><br /><br />
      Inspect CPU, memory, disks, networking, and system processes without switching between terminal sessions and separate monitoring tools.
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>Remote desktop and workspaces</strong><br /><br />
      Native RDP, dynamic resolution, clipboard text, and file transfer in draggable, resizable, restorable multi-workspace layouts.
    </td>

    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>Network device command templates</strong><br /><br />
      Built-in query commands for Huawei, H3C, Ruijie, ZTE and other mainstream network devices; supports custom category grouping, search filtering, right-click move and dynamic category management.

      <strong>Credential and connection safety</strong><br /><br />
      Secrets live in Windows Credential Manager. SSH host-key changes block the connection until the user confirms a safe replacement.

## Download and get started

> **Current version: [`v1.0.0` stable](https://github.com/xsenrain/RainTerminal/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**

| File | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| [`RainTerminal_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe`](https://github.com/xsenrain/RainTerminal/releases/download/v1.0.0/RainTerminal_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe) | Recommended NSIS installer for most users |
| [`SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/xsenrain/RainTerminal/releases/download/v1.0.0/SHA256SUMS.txt) | Installer integrity verification |

> [!WARNING]
> The Windows installers are not Authenticode-signed yet, so SmartScreen may display a warning. Back up important connection metadata before testing and download files only from this repository's Releases page.

Verify an installer in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\RainTerminal_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the result with the matching entry in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows 10 / 11 x64** | Supported with NSIS EXE bundles |
| iOS / iPadOS | Planned, but not currently available |
| macOS / Linux / Android | No supported build yet |

RainTerminal currently relies on Windows Credential Manager, ConPTY, local process management, and native RDP clipboard integration. Mobile platforms need dedicated UX, native capability, and signing work rather than only a different CI runner.

## Security by design

- SSH and RDP secrets are stored in Windows Credential Manager.
- Browser storage, workspace snapshots, and exported server JSON exclude passwords.
- Existing plaintext browser-storage credentials are migrated before the plaintext copy is removed.
- SSH helper connections use the user's OpenSSH `known_hosts`; new keys can be accepted, while mismatches are blocked pending confirmation.
- Diagnostics are designed to exclude credentials, server addresses, and local paths.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and the current support policy.
